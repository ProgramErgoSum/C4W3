# Project 2 - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) analysis
#  
# Q: Across the United States, how have emissions 
#    from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?
#
# A: The following can be inferred about the emissions from coal based combustion sources.       
#    * Most states have emissions well below the average from 1999 to 2008.      
#    * Few states have had close to average emissions in 1999 but have since improved to below average levels by 2008.
#    * Only one state has had an increasing trend from below average to close to average from 1999 to 2008.
